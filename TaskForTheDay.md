Title: Extract and Integrate Basketball Match Statistics from PDF
──────────────────────────────

Overview: ⚠️ (Partially Completed)
Develop a Node.js Express (type=module) service that processes a basketball match statistic PDF, extracts both team-level and player-level data, checks for duplicate entries, and uploads the parsed data to the EtrosAPI database. Only admins should be permitted to perform the upload.

──────────────────────────────

Objectives
✅ Create a secure module (admin-only access) to accept and process a basketball statistic PDF.
✅ Parse and extract key data fields including overall match details, team statistics, and individual player statistics.
✅ Implement a duplicate check mechanism to avoid re-uploading the same match statistics.
⚠️ Integrate with the existing EtrosAPI endpoints to store the extracted data (Basic integration done, some features missing).
❌ Provide robust error handling, logging, and testing.

────────────────────────────── 2. Requirements & Functional Specifications

A. Input and PDF Parsing
✅ Accept a PDF file with a layout similar to "FIBA_Box_Score_GOCh_vs_ETR_04_qnuari.pdf"
✅ Use a Node.js PDF parsing library (using pdf-parse) to extract the text content.
⚠️ Identify and extract:
✅ Match metadata: game number, date, start time, attendance, game duration
⚠️ Team-level statistics:
✅ Overall points
❌ Scoring breakdowns (points from turnovers, points in the paint, bench points)
❌ Scoring intervals
✅ Player-level statistics: player name, minutes played, field goal stats, etc.
❌ Coach and additional match summary information

B. Data Transformation and Validation
⚠️ Map the extracted data to your database schema (Basic mapping done)
❌ Validate and convert numerical and date fields comprehensively
✅ Handle edge cases such as "DNP" entries

C. Duplicate Checking
✅ Implement check to prevent duplicate uploads by comparing opponent and match date
✅ Skip if duplicate is detected
✅ Proper duplicate handling response

D. API Integration
⚠️ Utilize EtrosAPI's endpoints:
✅ Inserting new match records
✅ Adding team-level statistics
✅ Adding individual player statistics
⚠️ Error handling and logging needs improvement

E. Security
✅ Ensure that only authenticated admin users can perform the upload
✅ Implementation of authentication middleware and authorization checks

────────────────────────────── 3. Technical Implementation

A. Environment & Tools
✅ Use Node.js with Express.js (type=module)
✅ PDF parsing library implementation
✅ Authentication/authorization setup

B. Implementation Steps

✅ PDF Ingestion and Parsing:
✅ API endpoint for file uploads with admin protection
✅ PDF parsing implementation
✅ Text segmentation logic

✅ Data Extraction & Mapping:
✅ Header identification
✅ Data type conversion
✅ Data organization

✅ Duplicate Check Logic:
✅ Database querying for duplicates
✅ Duplicate handling

⚠️ API Communication:
✅ POST new match data
❌ Proper error handling and retries

❌ Testing and Logging:
❌ Unit tests
❌ Integration tests
❌ Comprehensive logging

────────────────────────────── 4. Additional Considerations

❌ Scalability:
❌ Concurrent PDF processing
❌ Job queues

❌ Extensibility:
❌ Modular design for future adjustments
❌ Documentation for modifications

✅ Security:
✅ Admin-only access
✅ Authentication/authorization

❌ Documentation:
❌ Inline documentation
❌ README
❌ Deployment instructions

────────────────────────────── 5. Deliverables

⚠️ Codebase:
✅ Secure PDF upload endpoint
✅ PDF parsing module
✅ Duplicate check implementation
⚠️ API integration
❌ Tests
❌ Deployment instructions
❌ API documentation

────────────────────────────── 6. Acceptance Criteria

⚠️ Accurate extraction of match, team, and player statistics (Basic stats done, some advanced stats missing)
✅ Reliable duplicate checking
⚠️ Data insertion with proper error handling (Needs improvement)
✅ Admin-only access
❌ Code modularity, documentation, and test coverage

STATUS SUMMARY:
✅ Completed: Basic PDF parsing, data extraction, admin security, duplicate checking
⚠️ Partial: Error handling, data validation, API integration
❌ Pending: Testing, documentation, advanced stats, logging, scalability features
